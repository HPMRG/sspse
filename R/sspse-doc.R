#' A Pair of Simulated RDS Data Sets with no seed dependency
#' 
#' This is a faux set used to illustrate how the estimators for 
#' multiple Respondent-Driven sampling surveys perform under
#' different populations and RDS schemes.
#' 
#' The population is based on \code{fauxmadrona} from the \code{RDS} package. 
#' It is a population with N=1000 nodes from which two successive respondent-driven samples are drawn.
#' For the first survey, the sample size is 200 so
#' that there is a relatively small sample fraction (20\%). There is homophily
#' on disease status (R=5) and there is differential activity by disease status
#' whereby the infected nodes have mean degree twice that of the uninfected
#' (w=1.8).
#' 
#' In the sampling, the seeds are chosen randomly from the full population, so
#' there is no dependency induced by seed selection.
#' 
#' Each sample member is given 2 uniquely identified coupons to distribute to
#' other members of the target population in their acquaintance.  Further each
#' respondent distributes their coupons completely at random from among those
#' they are connected to.
#' 
#' For the second sample the sample size is 250. The second survey has an additional variable \code{recapture} 
#' indicating if the respondent was also surveyed in the first survey.
#' 
#' Each survey is represented as an \code{rds.data.frame} and they are stored in a list with two elements. 
#' 
#' @name fauxmadrona2
#' @aliases fauxmadrona2
#' @docType data
#' @format A list with the first element being an \code{rds.data.frame} of the first survey and the
#' second element being an \code{rds.data.frame} of the second survey.
