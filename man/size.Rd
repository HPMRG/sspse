\title{Exponential Family Random Graph Models}
\description{
  \code{\link{size}} is used to fit linear exponential random network models, in which
  the probability of a given network, \eqn{y}, on a set of nodes is 
  \eqn{\exp(\theta{\cdot}g(y))/c(\theta)}, where 
  \eqn{g(y)} is a vector of network statistics,
  \eqn{\theta} is a parameter vector of the same length and \eqn{c(\theta)} is the
  normalizing constant for the distribution.
  \code{\link{size}} can return either a maximum pseudo-likelihood
  estimate or an approximate maximum likelihood estimator based on a Monte Carlo scheme.

\section{Model Terms}{
  The \code{\link{size}} function allows the user to explore a large number
  of potential models for their network data.  The
  terms currently supported by the program,
  and a brief description of each is given in the documentation
  \code{\link{size-terms}}. 
  In the \code{\link{formula}} for the model, the model terms are various function-like
  calls, some of which require arguments, separated by \code{+} signs.
  For a more detailed understanding of the model terms, see and Morris, Handcock and Hunter (2008).

\section{Notes on model specification}{
Although each of the statistics in a given model is a summary
statistic for the entire network, it is rarely necessary to
calculate statistics for an entire network
in a proposed Metropolis-Hastings step.
%  The reason for this is that we may assume that each statistic equals
% zero for the observed network (translating each statistic by
% a constant does not change the probability model), and then
% it is only necessary to calculate the changes in the various
%statistics for a proposed Metropolis-Hastings step.  
Thus, for example, if the triangle term is included in the model,
a census of all triangles in the observed network is never
taken; instead, only the change in the number of triangles
is recorded for each edge toggle.

In the implementation of \code{\link{size}}, the model is initialized
in \R, then all the model information is passed to a C program
that generates the sample of network statistics using MCMC.
This sample is then returned to \R, which implements a
simple Newton-Raphson algorithm to approximate the MLE.
An alternative style of maximum likelihood estimation is to use a stochastic
approximation algorithm. This can be chosen with the 
\code{control.size(style="Robbins-Monro")} option.
%There seems little reason to implement the Newton-Raphson
%algorithm in C since it moves very quickly in \R and
%it is easier to alter the code if it is written in \R.

The default mechanism for proposing new networks for the MCMC sample 
space is the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which simply chooses a dyad 
at random and proposes to toggle that edge; each possible dyad is 
equally likely.  The \code{proposaltype} 
option allow many more complex proposals to be specified.
We have developed and implemented a wide range of algorithms. These are 
described in the documentation for \code{proposaltype}.
%, including a double
%Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (two random toggles); an algorithm
%that reallocates all the edges of one node, with replacement;
%and an algorithm that toggles all dyads based on a single node
%(i.e., gives the complement edges for all dyads rooted at
%a randomly chosen node).
For example, we have included proposal functions that condition on
maintaining the absolute degree distribution for the observed
network.  Each proposal network will have exactly the same number
of nodes with each degree as does the original network; this
means that if the proposal network removes an edge between a
node of degree 3 and a node of degree 5, it must also add
an edge between a node of degree 2 and a node of degree 4.
Note that one or both of the latter nodes may be the same as
the former nodes.

The package is designed so that the user can add additional 
proposal types. 
}
  
\section{Placing Bounds on Degrees:}{
There are many times when one may wish to condition on the
number of inedges or outedges possessed by a node, either as a
consequence of some intrinsic property of that node (e.g., to control for 
activity or popularity processes), to account
for known outliers of some kind, and thus we wish to limit its indegree, an
intrinsic property of the sampling scheme whence came our data (e.g.,
the survey asked everyone to name only three friends total) or as a
function of the attributes of the nodes to which a node has edges
(e.g., we specify that nodes designated \dQuote{male} have a maximum number
of outdegrees to nodes designated \dQuote{female}).  To accomplish this we
use the \code{constraints} term  \code{bd}.

Let's consider the simple cases first. 
Suppose you want to condition on the total number of degrees
regardless of attributes.  That is, if you had a survey that asked
respondents to name three alters and no more, then you might want to
limit your maximal outdegree to three without regard to any of the
alters' attributes. The argument is then:  

   \code{constraints=~bd(maxout=3)}

Similar calls are used to restrict the number of indegrees
(\code{maxin}), the minimum number of outdegrees
(\code{minout}), and the minimum number of indegrees
(\code{minin}).

You can also set ego specific limits. For example:

   \code{constraints=bd(maxout=rep(c(3,4),c(36,35)))}

limits the first 36 to 3 and the other 35 to 4 outdegrees.

Multiple restrictions can be combined. \code{bd} is very flexible.
In general, the \code{bd} term can contain up to five arguments:

  \preformatted{
    bd(attribs=attribs,
       maxout=maxout,
       maxin=maxin,
       minout=minout,
       minin=minin)
  }

Omitted arguments are unrestricted, and arguments of length 1
are replicated out to all nodes (as above). If an individual
entry in \code{maxout},..., \code{minin} is \code{NA} then
no restriction of that kind is applied to that actor.

In general, \code{attribs} is a matrix of the attributes on
which we are conditioning.  The dimensions of \code{attribs}
are \code{n_nodes} rows by \code{attrcount} columns, where
\code{attrcount} is the number of distinct attribute values
on which we want to condition (i.e., a separate column is
required for \dQuote{male} and \dQuote{female} if we want to condition on
the number of ties to both \dQuote{male} and \dQuote{female} partners).
The value of \code{attribs[n, i]}, therefore, is \code{TRUE}
if node \code{n} has attribute value i, and \code{FALSE} otherwise.
(Note that, since each column represents only a single value
of a single attribute, the values of this matrix are all
Boolean (\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}).)  It is important to
note that \code{attribs} is a matrix of nodal attributes,
not alter attributes.

So, for instance, if we wanted to construct an \code{attribs} matrix
with two columns, one each for male and female attribute
values (we are conditioning on these values of the attribute
\dQuote{sex}), and the attribute sex is represented in ads.sex as
an \code{n_node}-long vector of 0s and 1s (men and women),
then our code would look as follows:

\preformatted{
 # male column: bit vector, TRUE for males
 attrsex1 <- (ads.sex == 0) 
 # female column: bit vector, TRUE for females
 attrsex2 <- (ads.sex == 1)
 # now create attribs matrix
 attribs <- matrix(ncol=2,nrow=71, data=c(attrsex1,attrsex2))
}

\code{maxout} is a matrix of alter attributes, with the same
dimensions as the \code{attribs} matrix.  \code{maxout} is \code{n_nodes}
rows by \code{attrcount} columns.  The value of \code{maxout[n,i]},
therefore, is the maximum number of outdegrees permitted
from node \code{n} to nodes with the attribute \code{i} (where a \code{NA}
means there is no maximum).

For example:  if we wanted to create a \code{maxout} matrix to work
with our \code{attribs} matrix above, with a maximum from every
node of five outedges to males and five outedges to females,
our code would look like this:

\preformatted{
      # every node has maximum of 5 outdegrees to male alters
      maxoutsex1 <- c(rep(5,71))
      # every node has maximum of 5 outdegrees to female alters
      maxoutsex2 <- c(rep(5,71))
      # now create maxout matrix
      maxout <- cbind(maxoutsex1,maxoutsex2)
}

The \code{maxin}, \code{minout}, and \code{minin} matrices
are constructed exactly like the \code{maxout} matrix,
except for the maximum allowed indegree, the minimum allowed
outdegree, and the minimum allowed indegree, respectively.
Note that in an undirected network, we only look at the outdegree
matrices; \code{maxin} and \code{minin} will both be ignored
in this case.

% First, you would assign the \dQuote{ego} attribute to all your nodes -
% because every node is an ego, every node gets a \code{TRUE} (or 1) in its
% column in the \code{attribs} matrix.  

% \code{attribs <- matrix(ncol=1,nrow=71,data=c(rep(1,71)))}

% Then you would assign a maximum number of alter out degrees allowed
% to each ego in the same column as in the \code{attribs} matrix.  In this
% case, all egos have a maximum outdegree of 3.

% \code{maxout <- matrix(ncol=1,nrow=71,data=c(rep(3,71)))}

% Then, we can create dummy \code{maxin}, \code{minout},
% \code{minin} matrices (in the future these will be empty
% by default) and create the \code{} argument to pass
% into the \code{\link{size}} call.

% To create \dQuote{dummy} \code{maxin}, \code{minout}, and
% \code{minin} matrices to correspond to the \code{attribs} and
% \code{maxout} matrices created above, that impose no limits
% on the amount of edges allowed, our code would look like this:

% \code{maxin <- matrix(NA,ncol=2,nrow=71)
%       minout <- matrix(NA,ncol=2,nrow=71)
%	minin <- matrix(NA,ncol=2,nrow=71)}

%  The argument we pass into the \code{\link{size}} call, then would look like this:

%  \code{ = list( attribs=attribs,
%        	         maxout=maxout,
%        	         maxin=maxin,
%        	         minout=minout,
%        	         minin=minin)}

%  This argument passed into \code{\link{size}} will now restrict your proposed 
%  networks to those which meet your desired degree conditions.
  

%  \code{ = list( attribs=attribs,
%        	         maxout=maxout,
%        	         maxin=matrix(NA,ncol=1,nrow=71),
%        	         minout=matrix(NA,ncol=1,nrow=71),
%        	         minin=matrix(NA,ncol=1,nrow=71))}

\preformatted{
attribs[n][0] = 1 # just the ego values
maxout[n][0] = minout[n][0] = observed outdegree of n in network
maxin[n][0] = minin[n][0] = observed indegree of n in network
  }
}
 
%\section{Dealing with degeneracy}{
%In order to begin the process of estimating network coefficients,
%we need starting values - guesses at the true values of the
%network statistic coefficients.  The default is to begin the MCMC
%estimation process at the deterministic MPLE values. These
%values are often taken as good-enough final answers by many other
%applications. However recent work has indicated that they are sub-optimal and
%can be dramatically bad.
%
%In using the MPLE values, MCMC MLE often runs into
%problems caused by the inherent instability of the natural parameter
%space of the models (Handcock 2000, 2002, 2003).
%If the initial values for the parameter coefficients
%are off by a very small amount in the wrong direction, the
%result is often a sample of networks that are degenerate -
%that is, networks that are entirely full or entirely empty,
%or that are otherwise less-than-representative of the
%sample of network space our process is attempting to explore.
%(In part, this is an indication of why one should not rely
%solely on the MPLE). The package contains many algorithmic 
%tools to obtain quality inference.
%If the sample of networks is
%degenerate, our algorithm will fail in its calculation of an
%MLE for our data (usually in constructing the Hessian matrix).
%%In this case, we can attempt to converge using the Robbins-Monro
%%algorithm, minimizing the Euclidean distance between the mean of
%%the sample network statistics and the observed network statistics
%%as a function of the theta vector.  While this is a fairly
%%blunt instrument for estimating the thetas in comparison to
%%the MCMC, it still has the potential to get us thetas in the
%%right range; then we can run the MCMC again, using our better
%%estimates of theta.  A potential problem with this technique is
%%that it only works well if the space of sufficient statistics
%%is sufficiently regular around our sample network; but as a
%%stop-gap measure, it has shown some limited success.
%See the references for details, especially Handcock (2003) and Hunter and
%Handcock (2006).
