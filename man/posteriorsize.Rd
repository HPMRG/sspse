\item{type.impute}{The type of imputation to use for the summary visibilities 
(returned in the component \code{visibilities}. The imputes are based on the posterior

It can be of type \code{distribution}, \code{mode},\code{median}, or \code{mean} 
with \code{median} the default, being the posterior median of the visibility for that person.}

\item{Np}{integer; The overall visibility distribution is a mixture of the
\code{Np} rates for \code{1:Np} and a parametric visibility distribution model
truncated below \code{Np}. Thus the model fits the proportions of the
population with visibility \code{1:Np} each with a separate parameter. This
should adjust for an lack-of-fit of the parametric visibility distribution model
at lower visibilities, although it also changes the model away from the
parametric visibility distribution model.}

\eqn{s} automatically and not usually specified by the user.}

distribution for the log of the optimism parameter (that is, gamma).}

distribution for the log of the s.d. in the optimism model.}

sub-step for the visibility distribution parameters (\eqn{\beta}) before any
MCMC sampling is done. It typically is set to a modestly large number.}

Monte-Carlo sample.  This uses MPI or PSOCK. The default is 1, that is not to
use parallel processing.}

"PSOCK" or "MPI". This requires the corresponding type to be installed.
The default is "PSOCK".}

use whatever the state of the random number generator is at the time of the
call.}

\item{maxbeta}{scalar; The maximum allowed value of the \code{beta} parameter.
If the implied or computed value is higher, it is reduced to this value.
This is done for numerical stability reasons.}

\item{supplied}{list; If supplied, is a list with components \code{maxN} and
\code{sample}. In this case \code{supplied} is a matrix with a column named
\code{N} being a sample from a prior distribution for the population size.
The value \code{maxN} specifies the maximum value of the population size, a
priori.}

\item{max.coupons}{The number of recruitment coupons distributed to each 
enrolled subject (i.e. the maximum number of recruitees for any subject).
By default it is taken by the attribute or data, else the maximum recorded number of coupons.}

\item{recruit.time}{vector; An optional value for the data/time that the person was interviewed.
It needs to resolve as a numeric vector with number of elements the number
of rows of the data with non-missing values of the network variable. If it
is a character name of a variable in the data then that variable is used.
If it is NULL then the sequence number of the recruit in the data is used.
If it is NA then the recruitment is not used in the model.
Otherwise, the recruitment time is used in the model to better predict
the visibility of the person.}

\item{recruit.time2}{vector; An optional value for the data/time that the person in the second RDS survey was interviewed.
It needs to resolve as a numeric vector with number of elements the number
of rows of the data with non-missing values of the network variable. If it
is a character name of a variable in the data then that variable is used.
If it is NULL, the default, then the sequence number of the recruit in the data is used.
If it is NA then the recruitment is not used in the model.
Otherwise, the recruitment time is used in the model to better predict
the visibility of the person.}

\item{include.tree}{logical; If \code{TRUE}, 
augment the reported network size by the number of recruits and one for the recruiter (if any).
This reflects a more accurate value for the visibility, but is not the self-reported degree.
In particular, it typically produces a positive visibility (compared to a
possibility zero self-reported degree).}

\item{unit.scale}{numeric; If not \code{NULL} it sets the numeric value of the scale parameter
of the distribution of the unit sizes.
For the negative binomial, it is the multiplier on the variance of the negative binomial 
compared to a Poisson (via the Poisson-Gamma mixture representation). Sometimes the scale is 
unnaturally large (e.g. 40) so this give the option of fixing it (rather than using
the MLE of it). The model is fit with the parameter fixed at this passed value.}

\item{optimism}{logical; If \code{TRUE} then add a term to the model allowing
the (proportional) inflation of the self-reported degrees relative to the unit sizes.}

\item{reflect.time}{logical; If \code{TRUE} then the \code{recruit.time} is the time before the 
end of the study (instead of the time since the survey started or chronological time).}

\item{equalize}{logical; If \code{TRUE} and the capture-recapture model is used, adjusts for gross differences in the 
reported network sizes between the two samples.}

\item{verbose}{logical; if this is \code{TRUE}, the program will print out
additional information, including goodness of fit statistics.}

\description{
\code{\link{posteriorsize}} computes the posterior distribution of the
population size based on data collected by Respondent Driven Sampling. The
approach approximates the RDS via the Sequential Sampling model of Gile
(2008). As such, it is referred to as the Sequential Sampling - Population Size Estimate (SS-PSE).
It uses the order of selection of the sample to provide information
on the distribution of network sizes over the population members.
}
\section{Details on priors}{
 The best way to specify the prior is via the
hyperparameter \code{mode.prior.size} which specifies the mode of the prior
distribution on the population size. You can alternatively specify the
hyperparameter \code{median.prior.size} which specifies the median of the
prior distribution on the population size, or \code{mean.prior.sample
proportion} which specifies the mean of the prior distribution on the
proportion of the population size in the sample or \code{mode.prior.sample
proportion} which specifies the mode of the prior distribution on the
proportion of the population size in the sample. Finally, you can specify
\code{quartiles.prior.size} as a vector of length 2 being the pair of lower
and upper quartiles of the prior distribution on the population size.
